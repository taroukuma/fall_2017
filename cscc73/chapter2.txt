Divide and Conquer:
It involves us doing three things:
- divide the problem into subproblems of the same type. this is where we need to come up with a smart way of dividing the problem.
- recursively dividing the problem into a number of small problems allows us to solve those small ones very easily.
- the other smart comes when we have to glue these solutions for the small problems into a solution for the big original problem.

Gaussian multiplication of complex numbers:
- instead of doing four real multiplications, we can do this in three and four additional (additions or subtractions).

Why is being able to do this with three multiplications instead of four significant
- we can apply this technique to solving a real multiplication more efficiently.
- infact, it reduces the running time from O(n^2) to O(n^1.59).
