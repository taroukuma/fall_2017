what are algorithms?
- They are procedures that are precise, unambiguous, mechanical, and correct?
What is a recurrence relation?
- it is when you have an equation for a sequence of elements where the nth element is defined as it predecessors.
Big O notation:
- it is a function of input size (what exactly is this?) that tells us the number of basic computer steps.
- i,e., f: N -> R
