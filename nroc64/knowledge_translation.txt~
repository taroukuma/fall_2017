Neurons or the nerve cells are the basic functional units in the brain. The vast network of these cells underlie the sophisticated behaviours we see in humans and other animals. The Neurodegenerative diseases refer to a class of conditions that are characterized by progressive loss of neurons in the brain. Parkinson's disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. Some of the physical symptoms resulting from this disorder include tremors and rigidity which may lead to slow movements, difficulty maintaining body posture, and other motor impairments. Psychological effects include sleep disturbances, anxiety, depression, panic attacks, and pain. Whole body vibration is a potential rehabilitation treatment that aims to address the significant loss of muscle strength commonly found in patients with parkinson's disease. In this information "sheet", I will briefly discuss the effectiveness of this technique in treating that aspect of parkinson's disease.
