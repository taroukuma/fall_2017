Neurons or the nerve cells are the basic functional units in the brain. The vast network of these cells underlie the sophisticated behaviours we see in humans and other animals. The Neurodegenerative diseases refer to a class of conditions that are characterized by progressive loss of neurons in the brain. Parkinson's disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. Some of the physical symptoms resulting from this disorder include tremors and rigidity which may lead to slow movements, difficulty maintaining body posture, and other motor impairments. Psychological effects include sleep disturbances, anxiety, depression, panic attacks, and pain. Whole body vibration is a potential rehabilitation treatment that aims to address the significant loss of muscle strength commonly found in patients with parkinson's disease. In this information "sheet", I will briefly discuss the effectiveness of this technique in treating the common symptoms found in individuals with parkinson's.

what constitutes motor impairments?
what are some of the things that people with motor impairments deal with in everyday life?
how does it progress over lifetime?

limitations in the findings?

One of the classic symptoms shown by patients with this disorder is the impairment of motor capabilities. This can be measured in terms of tremors, muscle rigidity, and slowness of movement. It therefore comes with no surprise that PD patients deal with reduced quality of life due to higher fall frequency and increased risk of fatal accidents. Based on the studies by Hass et al and King et al, signigicant reductions in tremors and rigidity  were found in patients after a single session of whole body vibration compared to the control group that did not recieve any treatment. However the results of long term treatment of this technique investigated by Ebersbach et al and Arias et al do not seem very promising. The former team found that the patients that went through three and four weeks of WBV treatment did not do show any improvements compared to the patients in the control group. The other team found that patients that went through multiple sessions of WBV showed results comparable to those that performed conventional exercises. These results lead to the conclusion that WBV treatment at best only has temporary therapeutic effects in regards to motor impairments.
