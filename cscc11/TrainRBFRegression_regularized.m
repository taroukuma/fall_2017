% [w]=TrainRBFRegression(z,P,C,sig,lambda)
%
% This function computes the weights for RBF
%  regression on a set of pixel values from an image
%  patch. The goal is to fit a model to the pattern
%  of image brightness in the patch so we can use it
%  for inpainting and denoising
%
%  This is the version with regularization
%
%  The RBF model is the same as before:
%
%  z_i = sum_k  w_k * RBF_k(p_i)
%
%  Where z_i is an observed pixel value at location p_i=[x_i 
%                                                        y_i]
%
%  Each RBF has a center c_k=[x_k  and width 'sig'
%                             y_k]
%
% z - One-column vector with pixel values at each of the
%     sampled points in P
%
% P - 2-row array in which each column gives the coordinates
%     of a pixel in the patch, i.e.
%
%     P=[x_1   x_2  ....    x_n
%        y_1   y_2  ....    y_n]
%
% C - 2-row array in which each column gives the center for
%     one of the RBFs, i.e.
%
%     C=[cx_1  cx_2 ....   cx_k
%        cy_1  cy_2 ....   cy_k]
%
% sig - width of the RBFs (all have the same width)
%
% lambda - regularization parameters in [0, .5]
%

%
% TO DO: Complete this function to set up the regression
%        problem and solve for the weights w that correspond
%        to the least-squares estimate that fits the observed
%        data using regularization.
